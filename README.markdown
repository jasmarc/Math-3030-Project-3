Math 3030 Project III
=====================

This was a project for Math 3030 at [Georgia State University](http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwmat/). The actual assignment is given in the file Project-3.pdf. Math 3030 is "Math Models for Computer Science," which is an amalgam of Linear Algebra, Vector Calculus, and Probability & Statistics.

The Assignment
--------------
This particular assignment was for the Probability & Statistics part of the class. The idea was to figure out the statistics for the determinants of all possible 2x2 matrices consisting of only 1's and 0's (mean, variance, and standard deviation). The next part was to generate 15 of such matrices randomly and observe the differences in the statistics.

My Implementation
-----------------
I chose to implement this assignment using Ruby as it is one of my favorite languages. Since I knew I would be composing the final document in LaTeX, I had the Ruby code just generate LaTeX.
